How to add Custom Post template

To make a custom post template you have to crate a php function with a specific name. And Your function has to RETURN(NOT ECHO) the whole markup as a string.
After create the function you have to attatched/link your created function to function.php or via other plugin so that your created function can be access from any place from wordpress backend.

Function Name: $postType_template()
eg: post_template() , event_template(), member_template() etc

Example function:
// Default post template 
`function post_template($data){
    $c_id = $data->ID; 
    $title = get_the_title($c_id);
    $post_img_id = get_post_thumbnail_id($c_id);
    $post_img_url = return_post_img_url( $c_id , 'large' );
    $title = get_the_title($c_id);
    $html = '';

    $html .= '<a href="'.get_permalink().'" class="default-post-template">';
        $html .= '<img src="'.$post_img_url.'" alt="'.$title.'">';
        
        $html .= '<div class="text-section">';
            $html .= '<h3 class="title">'.$title.'</h3>';            
        $html .= '</div>';
    $html .= '</a>';

    return $html;
}`


Your defined  template function will receive a single post id  as its first argument. you can use the id to manupulate/make the posts mark template.

Note : You have to return the markup, you cant echo the markup from the function.
